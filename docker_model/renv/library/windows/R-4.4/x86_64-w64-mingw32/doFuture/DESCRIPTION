Description: The 'future' package provides a unifying parallelization framework for R that supports many parallel and distributed backends. The 'foreach' package provides a powerful API for iterating over an R expression in parallel. The 'doFuture' package brings the best of the two together. There are two alternative ways to use this package. The recommended approach is to use 'y <- foreach(...) %dofuture% { ... }', which does not require using 'registerDoFuture()' and has many advantages over '%dopar%'. The alternative is the traditional 'foreach' approach by registering the 'foreach' adapter 'registerDoFuture()' and so that 'y <- foreach(...) %dopar% { ... }' runs in parallelizes with the 'future' framework.
