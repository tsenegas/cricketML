title: "About me"
---

I'm Thibault Senegas, a self-taught programmer and expert in R and Shiny. As a Lead Data Scientist and Chief Product Owner at [quantum simulations\*](https://quantumsimulations.app), I lead the creation of digital twins for companies, sports teams, and geographical regions. My focus is on merging cutting-edge data science with real-world applications.

I hold an M.Sc. in International Business from HEC Montréal and a Master's degree in Engineering from INP/ENSIACET in Toulouse, France. Before joining quantum simulations\*, I honed my skills as a Data Scientist at IBM in their Advanced Analytics practice.

I currently reside in Montréal, QC, with my wife and two sons.
