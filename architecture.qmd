# 1. Data Storage and Ingestion

-   Amazon S3:
    -   Use S3 buckets to store raw high-frame-rate spatial-temporal data.
    -   Separate folders for raw data, pre-processed data, and model artifacts.
-   AWS Glue:
    -   Automate the ETL process to clean and transform data for model training and inference.
    -   Glue can handle the scale of data for multiple seasons and ensure structured data pipelines.

## 2. Model Training

-   Amazon SageMaker:
    -   Train models using SageMaker's built-in resources.
    -   Use a dedicated instance with 8 cores and large memory for the 8-hour training sessions.
    -   Store training metrics and artifacts in S3.

## 3. Model Prediction

-   AWS Batch:
    -   Schedule batch jobs for overnight predictions (50 games/day).
    -   Each game prediction requires a single CPU and 4 GB of memory for 60 minutes.
    -   Use Compute Environment configurations to scale EC2 resources for optimal cost-efficiency.

## 4. Data Warehouse:

-   Snowflake:
    -   Store structured data (aggregated predictions, historical data) for analytical queries.
    -   ntegration with S3 for seamless data loading and querying.

## 5. MLOps and Model Monitoring

-   Amazon CloudWatch:
    -   Monitor training and prediction jobs.
    -   Set up alarms for model performance degradation.
-   SageMaker Model Monitor:
    -   Track model performance metrics (e.g., prediction accuracy, latency) and data drift.

## 6. Visualization and Reporting

-   R Shiny or Streamlit:
    -   Deploy a visualization app to present model outputs, trends, and performance metrics.
    -   Host the app using a dockerized solution (shinyproxy works nicely)

## 7. Orchestration

-   Apache Airflow (Managed on AWS MWAA - Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow):
    -   Schedule and monitor workflows for ETL, model training, and predictions.
    -   Integrate with S3, Snowflake and SageMaker for seamless pipeline execution.

## 8. Scalability and Security

-   Auto-Scaling Groups:
    -   Dynamically scale EC2 instances based on workload for cost management.
-   IAM Roles:
    -   Manage access and permissions across AWS services to ensure data security.
-   VPC:
    -   Deploy services in a private network for enhanced security.
